            <p>My name is Erich Stremel. I was born in Burgenlenfeld, Germany in 1989. I moved to Kansas when I was 2
                years old, and was raised there until I was 13. When I turned 13, I then moved down to New Braunfels,
                TX and was raised the rest of the time there. </p>

            <p>I have lived here in Denver now for going on 5 years, and I love it. I worked in Oil and Gas for 7
                years, and decided it was not the right industry for me. I then decided to change my career path to
                coding and web development. </p>

            <p>Some of my favorite activities include: snowboarding, camping, hunting, and video games. I have a 4 year
                old dog named Jaeger who brings me a lot of joy in my life.</p>
